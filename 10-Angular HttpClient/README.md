## Http Client Introduction

 The HttpClient module in Angular is a powerful tool for making HTTP requests from your application to a server. It provides a convenient way to interact with APIs and retrieve data asynchronously.

-  HttpClient is a part of the '@angular/common/http' module in Angular.
-  HttpClient is built on top of the XMLHttpRequest API and provides a higher-level abstraction for handling HTTP requests and responses.
- It provides a simplified API for handling HTTP requests and responses, making it easier to work with RESTful APIs,  fetching data from servers, and sending data to servers.
- With the Angular HttpClient module, you can perform various HTTP operations such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
- HttpClient automatically performs JSON parsing and serialization, making it easier to work with JSON data in your requests and responses.
- HttpClient uses observables to handle asynchronous operations. This allows you to easily handle and transform the data returned by HTTP requests.
- It also supports features like request headers, query parameters, request/response interceptors, error handling, and more.
- You can find the official documentation for HttpClient by visiting this [link](https://angular.io/guide/understanding-communicating-with-http)
  
## HTTP Request

The parts of an HTTP request include:
-  **Request Line:** This is the first line of the request and contains the HTTP method (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), the URL or URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) of the resource being requested, and the HTTP version.
-  **Request Headers:** Headers provide additional information about the request, such as the type of data being sent, the content length, the accepted response formats, and more. Headers are key-value pairs separated by a colon (:).
-  **Body (Optional):** The body of the request contains any additional data that needs to be sent to the server, such as form data. This part is optional and not present in all types of requests.

## What is the meaning of APIs
-  An API is often used to enable communication between a client application (such as a web browser or a mobile app) and a server. 
-  The server exposes a set of endpoints or URLs that the client can send requests to, and the server responds with the requested data or performs the requested actions.
-  APIs can be used to access various services and resources, such as retrieving data from a database, interacting with external services (e.g., payment gateways, social media platforms), or controlling hardware devices.
-  APIs are commonly used in web development to build more dynamic and interactive applications. They provide a standardized way for different systems to interact and exchange information, enabling developers to leverage existing functionality and integrate different services into their applications.

## Importing HttpClientModule 

When you import the HttpClientModule, you enable the use of the HttpClient service across your application. This module offers the essential dependencies and configuration required for performing HTTP requests with HttpClient.

Import the HttpClientModule from the '@angular/common/http' module into AppModule(the root module of your application). Add the following import statement at the top of the file, then add *HttpClientModule* to the declaration array:
  
    ```
    import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';
     
    @NgModule({
      declarations: [
       //
      ],
      imports: [
        //
        HttpClientModule
      ],
      providers: [],
      bootstrap: [AppComponent]
    })
    export class AppModule { }
   ```

-  Once you have imported the HttpClient service into your component, you can then inject it into the component constructor.
    ```
      import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
    ```

    ```
      constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}
    ```

## Requesting data from a server

Use the HttpClient.get() method to fetch data from a server. The asynchronous method sends an HTTP request, and returns an Observable that emits the requested data when the response is received. The return type varies based on the observe and responseType values that you pass to the call.

Creating an instance of HttpClient: Explain how to create an instance of HttpClient in a component or service using dependency injection.

Making GET requests: Demonstrate how to use the HttpClient instance to make GET requests to retrieve data from a server. Show examples of how to handle the response using subscribe() and handle errors using catchError().

Making POST requests: Show how to use the HttpClient instance to make POST requests to send data to a server. Provide examples of how to send JSON data in the request body and handle the response.

Adding headers to requests: Explain how to add headers to HTTP requests using the HttpHeaders class. Show examples of adding common headers like Content-Type and Authorization.

Handling request options: Discuss how to set request options such as query parameters, request body, and observe options using the HttpParams and HttpObserve classes.

Interceptors: Introduce the concept of interceptors in Angular and explain how they can be used with HttpClient to intercept and modify HTTP requests and responses.

Error handling: Discuss different approaches to error handling in HttpClient requests, such as using the catchError() operator, handling specific error codes, and displaying error messages to the user.
