## Http Client Introduction

- Angular HttpClient is a built-in module in Angular that allows you to make HTTP requests to a server and retrieve data. 
- It provides a simplified API for handling HTTP requests and responses, making it easier to work with RESTful APIs.
- With the Angular HttpClient module, you can perform various HTTP operations such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
- It also supports features like request headers, query parameters, request/response interceptors, error handling, and more.

The parts of an HTTP request include:

-  **Request Line:** This is the first line of the request and contains the HTTP method (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), the URL or URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) of the resource being requested, and the HTTP version.
-  **Request Headers:** Headers provide additional information about the request, such as the type of data being sent, the content length, the accepted response formats, and more. Headers are key-value pairs separated by a colon (:).
-  **Body (Optional):** The body of the request contains any additional data that needs to be sent to the server, such as form data. This part is optional and not present in all types of requests.
