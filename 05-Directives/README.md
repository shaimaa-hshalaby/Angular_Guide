Directives
===========
Angular directives are a fundamental building block of Angular applications. They are used to extend and customize the behaviour of HTML elements in Angular templates. Directives allow you to create reusable components and manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) in a declarative and efficient way. There are three main types of directives in Angular:


| directive type | description |
|---|---|
| **Component directives** | They are used to create custom elements with their own logic and appearance |
| **Attributes directives** | These directives modify the behaviour or appearance of an existing HTML element. They are typically applied as attributes to existing HTML elements. [ngClass,ngStyle] are examples of attribute directives.|
| **structural directive** | These directives alter the structure of the DOM by adding or removing elements based on conditions. They are preceded by an asterisk (*) in the template.\n [*ngFor,*ngIf] examples of structural directives|

## Attribute Directives
### Built-in Attribute Directives

-  *NgClass*:	Adds and removes a set of CSS classes.
-  *NgStyle*:	Adds and removes a set of HTML styles.
-  *NgModel*:	Adds two-way data binding to an HTML form element.


#### NgClass:
you can add CSS classes condititionally depending on an expression by this directive

**Expression returns string**

  1. Create a component for this exercise, and add 2 style classes special & not-special to its style file:
     ```
        .special {
            width: 400px;
            background-color: aqua;
        }
        
        .not-special {
            width: 400px;
            background-color: blue;
            color: white;
        }
     ```

  2. Add a boolean property *isSpecial* to the component class as follows:
    
     ```
       isSpecial:boolean = true;
     ```


  3. Add div element to the template and add [ngClass] attribute directive with an expression to set the style to special or not-special
     ```
       <div  [ngClass]="isSpecial?'special':'not-special'"></div>
     ```

  4. add a button to toggle speciality as follows:

     ```
      <button (click)="isSpecial=!isSpecial">Toggle Speciality</button>
     ```

  5. The output should be as the following GIF

-  we cannot have more than one structural directive in the same element'
-  structural directive starts with *


## Create our own directive
1. class decorated by @Directive and then specify the selector which is a unique selector
2. constructor has a private argument with type elementRef, the angular is responsible for passing it to the directive constructor. this is a reference of the element that the directive setting on it.
3. add the directive to the declarations in the NgModule file

accessing element directly from the ElementRef is not a good practise, you can use Renderer

## Renderer 
in some cases angular does not access the dom -in some cases angular does not run inside the browser- so accessing the dom may throw errors in such cases.
the better scenario is to access the renderer 
the class is Renderer2
try method setStyle()


** creating directive by ng cli
ng g d <directive_name>

more about renderer 
https://angular.io/api/core/Renderer2


@HostListener() inside the directive

@HostBinding('dom property name') for easier link the renderer properties to attribute

**Binding to Directive properties** --> these properties can be added to the tag as attributes
annotate properties with @Input()


## Create Custom structural directive
-  TemplateRef
-  ViewContainerRef
-  property setter


## ngSwitch
[ngSwitch]="value"


To do lis
============
1. ngClass with expression returns array, or an object
