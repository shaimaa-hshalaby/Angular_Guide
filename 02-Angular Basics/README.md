# Angular Basics

-  angular CLI inject script code to the end of the index.html page, these scripts is responsible for firing angular code to be executed and replace the content of the index page with the component html
-  the entry point of the angular is main.ts
-  you will find this statement import { AppModule } from './app/app.module';
-  by default, angular does not scan all your files to search for components, instead you should tell angular about your components

# create components  manually or from angular CLI
-  ng generate component <COMPONENT_NAME>
-  ng g c <COMPONENT_NAME>
