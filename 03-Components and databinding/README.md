## View encapsulation
-    In Angular, a component's styles can be encapsulated within the component's host element so that they don't affect the rest of the application.
-    The default mode is *ViewEncapsulation.Emulated*
-    Add *encapsulation* attribute to *@Component()* decorator to specify which encapsulation mode will be activated.
-    There are 3 valid encapsulation modes as show in the table below
  

|     ENCAPSULATION MODE     |     DETAILS    |
|---|---|
|    ViewEncapsulation.Emulated    |   The component styles are only applied to the component's view and do not affect other elements in the application, emulating Shadow DOM behaviour.|
|    ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom    | Angular uses the browser's built-in Shadow DOM API to enclose the component's view inside a ShadowRoot.<br /> When Angular was created; most browsers were not supporting Shadow Dom.|
|    ViewEncapsulation.None     |  Any styles specified for the component are actually globally applied and can affect any HTML element present within the application.|


### ViewEncapsulation.Emulated

1. Create *ViewEncapsulationEmulatedComponent* and specify encapsulation type in the *@Component()* decorator with Emulated - it is not necessary because it is the default -as follows:
   
    ```
          import { Component, ViewEncapsulation } from '@angular/core';
          @Component({
            selector: 'app-view-encapsulation-emulated',
            template: `<p>paragraph inside ViewEncapsulationEmulatedComponent</p>`,
            styles: [
              `
               p {
                  background-color: pink;
               }
              `
            ],
            encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.Emulated
          })
          
          export class ViewEncapsulationEmulatedComponent {
          
          }

    ```

2. Add the following code to the root component template *app.component.html*

    ```
       <app-view-encapsulation-emulated></app-view-encapsulation-emulated>
       <p>paragraph outside the view-encapsulation-emulated component</p>
    ```

3. run the application with the command
   
    ```
      ng serve
    ```
    
4. navigate to http://localhost:4200/, and observe the style difference between the paragraph written inside the *ViewEncapsulationEmulatedComponent* and the paragraph written outside it.

5. If you use the browser developer tool, you can observe that the angular added an attribute which represents the component's unique identifier to the whole elements in each component view templates. and also changes the component's styles to include this attribute as shown in the screenshots below:

6. Those attributes are the reason why the styles of each component donâ€™t leak out to other components.

### ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom 

1. Create *ViewEncapsulationShadowDomComponent* and specify encapsulation type in the *@Component()* decorator with *ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom* and add a style to <h2> inside the component styles -as follows:
   
    ```
          import { Component, ViewEncapsulation } from '@angular/core';

          @Component({
            selector: 'app-view-encapsulation-shadow-dom',
            template: `<h2>heading 2 inside the view-encapsulation-shadow-dom component</h2>`,
            styles: [
              `
               h2 {
                  background-color: green;
               }
              `
            ],
            encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom
          })
          export class ViewEncapsulationShadowDomComponent {
          
          }


    ```

2. Add the following code to the root component template *app.component.html*

    ```
      <app-view-encapsulation-shadow-dom></app-view-encapsulation-shadow-dom>
      <h2>heading 2 outside the view-encapsulation-shadow-dom component</h2>
    ```

3. run the application, and navigate to http://localhost:4200/.
   
    
4. and observe the style difference between the heading written inside the *ViewEncapsulationShadowDomComponent* and the heading written outside it.

5. If you use the browser developer tool, you can observe that the angular added the heading tag <h2> which is written inside the component under a #shadow-root element which encapsulates the styles and prevent them from leaking out. (this depends on the native ShadowDOM APIs)
