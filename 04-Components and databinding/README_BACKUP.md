# Directives 

**ngIf** structural directive which means that it adds and removes elements
**ngIf else**

**ngStyle**
**ngClass**



**binding to custom property**
we know how to bind data to a property in the same component
but how to send data to a property in a nested component
use @input() decorator

**assigning alias to the @input(alias) decorator**

**binding to custom event**
to pass the event out of the component we use
      @Output eventName = new EventEmitter<dataType>()

the event emitter can reach to the outer component or the parent component not the sublings
