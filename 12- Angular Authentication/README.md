## Overview
In the upcoming sections of this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of building a comprehensive authentication module for your Angular applications.
We'll cover the following key aspects:

  1.  Setting up a new Angular project.
  2.  Creating a registration form for user sign-up.
  3.  Implementing a login form for user authentication.
  4.  Enabling user logout functionality.
  5.  Handling token expiration and implementing token refresh.
  6.  Adding route guards to protect authenticated routes.
   
By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a solid understanding of how to integrate user authentication into your Angular applications,
enhancing both security and user experience.

## Preparing the Firebase as a backend for your Authentication module
Firebase provides a robust and scalable platform that simplifies many aspects of backend development, including user authentication.
By the end of this section, you'll have a Firebase project ready to handle user registration, authentication

      -  In the Firebase project dashboard, click on the gear icon (Project settings) and select "General."
      -  Scroll down to the "Your apps" section and click on the "Web" icon to add a new web app.
      -  Register the app and Firebase will provide you with a configuration object. Copy this object for later use.
7. To integrate Firebase in Your Angular Project:
      -  In your Angular project folder, install the Firebase dependencies using:
          ```
           npm install firebase 
          ```
