## Overview
In the upcoming sections of this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of building a comprehensive authentication module for your Angular applications.
We'll cover the following key aspects:

  1.  Setting up a new Angular project.
  2.  Creating a registration form for user sign-up.
  3.  Implementing a login form for user authentication.
  4.  Enabling user logout functionality.
  5.  Handling token expiration and implementing token refresh.
  6.  Adding route guards to protect authenticated routes.
   
By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a solid understanding of how to integrate user authentication into your Angular applications,
enhancing both security and user experience.

## Preparing the Firebase as a backend for your Authentication module
Firebase provides a robust and scalable platform that simplifies many aspects of backend development, including user authentication.
By the end of this section, you'll have a Firebase project ready to handle user registration, authentication

1. sign up for a Firebase account https://firebase.google.com/
2. click on "Go to console" button on the top header
3. create project and follow the instructions
4. In your Firebase project dashboard, navigate to the "Authentication" section.

6. Enable the sign-up methods you want to support, such as email/password or Google authentication.
7. To Get Firebase Config:
      -  In the Firebase project dashboard, click on the gear icon (Project settings) and select "General."
      -  Scroll down to the "Your apps" section and click on the "Web" icon to add a new web app.
      -  Register the app and Firebase will provide you with a configuration object. Copy this object for later use.
8. To integrate Firebase in Your Angular Project:
      -  In your Angular project folder, install the Firebase dependencies using:
          ```
           npm install firebase 
          ```
9. Use the Angular CLI to generate environment files for the project. By default, Angular CLI generates the src/environments/environment.ts file for the development environment. To generate an environment file for the production environment, you can use the following command:
    ```
      ng generate environments
    ```
10. To configure firebase, open the src/environments/environment.ts file. then Paste the Firebase configuration object obtained in Step 7 inside the firebase property.
