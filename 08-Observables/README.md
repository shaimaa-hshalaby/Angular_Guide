## Observables

-  An observable is a powerful tool used for handling asynchronous operations.
-  It is a part of the RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) library which is imported by default in Angular, which provides a set of operators to work with streams of data. So you need to import it from rxjs to be able to work with it.
```
  import { of, Observable, Subscription } from 'rxjs';
```
-  An observable represents a stream of data that can be observed over time.
-  It can emit multiple values asynchronously and can be subscribed to by multiple observers.
-  An observable can deliver multiple values of any type â€”literals, messages, or events, depending on the context.
-  Observable is a generic class and you can specify the type of the values that it will emit during the declaration of the Observale object as follows:
  ```
    myObservable:Observable<number> 
  ```

To understand Angular Observables, we need to understand the observer *design pattern*

### Observer Design pattern
The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.
The observers can subscribe or unsubscribe from the subject-object by calling its methods

### Observable Creation: 
Observables can be created using various methods, such as of(), from(), interval(), or by creating custom observables using the Observable class constructor.
  -  **of():**
   The of() operator creates an Observable that emits a sequence of values that you provide as arguments. It emits the values synchronously and completes immediately after emitting all the values. you should import the operator and then use it as follows:
     ```
       import { Observable, of} from 'rxjs';
     ```
   
      ```
        observable:Observable<number> = of(1,2,3,4)
      ```

  -  **from():**
   The from() operator creates an Observable from an array, an iterable, a Promise, or an Observable-like object. It emits each item from the source one by one and completes when all items have been emitted. you should import the operator and then use it as follows:
     ```
       import { Observable, from} from 'rxjs';
     ```
     
     ```
      strs:string[] =['hello','world','from','observable']
      from_observable:Observable<string> = from(this.strs)
     ```

  -  **interval():** The interval() operator returns an Observable that emits an infinite sequence of ascending integers, with a constant interval of time of your choosing between those emissions. The first emission is not sent immediately, but only after the first period has passed. you should import the operator and then use it as follows:
     ```
       import { Observable, interval} from 'rxjs';
     ```
     ```
       interval_observable:Observable<number> = interval(1000)
     ```

- **Observable constructor**
  you can create a custom observable using the Observable constructor which accepts the observer as a parameter as follows:
    ```
       myObservable = new Observable<number>(observer =>{
          let counter = 0;
          setInterval(()=>{
            observer.next(counter++)
          },1000)
        //    
        })
     ```
   
### Observer Structure
In RxJS, the Observer class is an interface that defines the structure of an object that can receive notifications from an Observable. It provides three methods: next, error, and complete.

  ![image](https://github.com/shaimaa-hshalaby/Angular_Guide/assets/3264417/dfe2d6fe-c614-46dc-a26c-daef20a3c43c)

The next(), error(), and complete() methods in the observer have specific signatures

  #### next(value: any): void 
  The next() method is used to emit a value to the observer. It takes a single parameter value of type any, which represents the value being emitted. The method does not return anything (void).
  
  #### error(error: any): void: 
  The error() method is used to emit an error to the observer. It takes a single parameter error of type any, which represents the error being emitted. The method does not return anything (void).
  
  #### complete(): void: 
  The complete() method is used to indicate that the observable has been completed and will no longer emit any values. It does not take any parameters and does not return anything (void). If the observable calls the complete() method of the observer, the next() method will no longer be called by the observable.

  ### Observer Declaration Example:

  ```
    observer = {
      next: (value: any) => {
        // Handle the emitted value
      },
      error: (error: any) => {
        // Handle the emitted error
      },
      complete: () => {
        // Handle the completion of the observable
      }
    };
  
  ```

### Subscribing to Observables:
-  When you subscribe to an Observable, you provide an object that implements the Observer interface. This object will receive the emitted values, handle errors, and be notified when the Observable completes.
-  To receive values emitted by an observable, you need to subscribe to it. 
-  An Observable instance begins publishing values only when someone subscribes to it.
-  the subscribe() method of the instance, passing an observer object to receive the notifications.
-  the subscribe() method returns an object of type **Subscription** that can be used to unsubscribe the observable when needed

  The following is an example of subscribing on an observable object and passing an observer object that implements the Observer Interface and passes the implementation of the 2 methods next(), and complete()
onSubscribe() function is a click event handler of a button created in the template

  ```
      logs:any[]=[]
      subscription:Subscription
    
      // create observable using of() fucntion imported from rxjs
      observable:Observable<number> = of(1,2,3,4)
    
      onSubscribe(){
        this.subscription = this.observable.subscribe(
          {
            next: value => this.logs.push(value),
            complete: ()=> this.logs.push("of observable completed")
          }
        )
      }
  ```

The behaviour should be as shown in the GIF below:
  ![Untitled design (7)](https://github.com/shaimaa-hshalaby/Angular_Guide/assets/3264417/2821352a-e41d-41cf-bccd-9e298f702d0f)


### Unsubscribing: 
-  It's important to unsubscribe from an observable when you no longer need to receive its values.
-  This prevents memory leaks and unnecessary processing. You can unsubscribe by calling the unsubscribe() method on the subscription object
returned by the subscribe() method.
-  You can clean up all subscriptions in onDestroy() method of the component instance.


### Error Handling: 
Observables can emit errors, and you can handle them using the error callback in the subscribe() method or by using error-handling operators
like catchError() or retry().

An Example of error handling by using the error callback in the observer object

1. Create an observable that emits an incremented number at specific intervals. Check if the number has reached more than 5, and if so, send an error message to the observer object.
    
   ```
      myObservable = new Observable<number>(observer =>{
        let counter = 0;
        setInterval(()=>{
          if(counter >5){
            observer.error("value could not be more than 10")
          }else{
            observer.next(counter++)
          }
          
        },1000)
      //    
      })
   ```

2. To receive data from the observable, you need to subscribe and provide an observer object that implements the next() and error() functions to handle the received data in every scenario.
    ```
        this.subscription = this.myObservable.subscribe(
          {
            next: value => this.logs.push(value),
            error: err => this.logs.push(err)
          }
        )
    ```

3. After an error is emitted, the observable stops emitting any further values.
4. When an error occurs in an observable, the complete function of the observer is not called.
5. The following GIF demonstrates the behaviour of the previous code.
   
    ![Untitled design (8)](https://github.com/shaimaa-hshalaby/Angular_Guide/assets/3264417/65644032-9a30-476a-ad42-6ee6caa21bfd)



### Operators: 
-  RxJS provides a wide range of operators that can be used to transform, filter, combine, or manipulate the data emitted by an observable.
Operators like map(), filter(), mergeMap(), and switchMap() is commonly used in Angular applications.
-  the operators are functions that can be applied to an Observable stream to transform, filter, or combine the emitted values.
-  These operators allow you to manipulate the data flowing through the Observable stream and perform various operations on it.

The official documentation of the RxJS operator is in this link: https://rxjs.dev/guide/operators


### Unicasting 
 When an Observable emits data, each subscriber receives its own independent stream of values. This behaviour is known as unicast, where each subscriber has its own separate execution of the Observable.
the following example demonstrates the unicasting behaviour:
1. Create an observable that emits an incremented number every second as follows:
     ```
       this.myObservable = new Observable<number>(observer =>{
          let counter = 0;
          setInterval(()=>{
            observer.next(counter++)
          },1000)
        //    
        })
     ```
    
2. Add two buttons to the template and create handlers for both. Each button should create a new subscription to the observable.
     ```
      <button (click)="onFirstSubscription()">First Subscription</button>
      <button (click)="onSecondSubscription()">Second Subscription</button>
     ```

     ```
        onFirstSubscription(){
          this.firstSubscription = this.myObservable.subscribe({
            next: value => this.firstSubscriptionLogs.push("First Subscription: "+value)
          })
        }
     ```


     ```
        onSecondSubscription(){
            this.secondSubscription = this.myObservable.subscribe({
              next: value => this.secondSubscriptionLogs.push("Second Subscription: "+value)
            })
          }
     ```

3. The following GIF demonstrates that the unicasting behaviour assigns a separate data source for each subscriber
   
    ![the count strats from zero](https://github.com/shaimaa-hshalaby/Angular_Guide/assets/3264417/32e6ebfa-9982-40b2-8856-b5255040b3e3)



### Multicasting
multicasting refers to the ability to send a single stream of data to multiple subscribers.
It allows you to share the same data stream among multiple components or services, ensuring that each subscriber receives the same values emitted by the source.

#### share() operator
Using the share() operator is a simple and efficient method to multicast an Observable. It takes care of maintaining the connection to the source Observable and tracks the active subscribers. Upon the first subscription, the share() operator automatically subscribes to the source Observable. If additional subscribers join while the source Observable is still active, they are automatically included in the multicast.

- modify the unicast example to work with multicast by calling pipe(share()) operator when creating the observable as follows:
  
  ```
    this.myObservable = new Observable<number>(observer =>{
      let counter = 0;
      setInterval(()=>{
        observer.next(counter++)
      },1000)
    //    
    }).pipe(share())
  ```

- This GIF showcases how the share() operator impacts behavior.

- For more control over multicasting, check also the publish() and replay() operators.
  
## More about Rxjs operators
### What are operators?
Operators are functions. There are two kinds of operators:
1. Pipeable Operators
2. Creation Operators

####  Pipeable Operators
-  Pipeable Operators are the kind that can be piped to Observables using the syntax observableInstance.pipe(operator)
-  When Pipeable Operators are called, they do not change the existing Observable instance. Instead, they return a new Observable, whose subscription logic is based on the first Observable.
-  A Pipeable Operator is essentially a pure function which takes one Observable as input and generates another Observable as output. Subscribing to the output Observable will also subscribe to the input Observable.

#### Creation Operators
-  Creation Operators are the other kind of operator, which can be called standalone functions to create a new Observable. For example: of(1, 2, 3) creates an observable that will emit 1, 2, and 3, one right after another.
- There are other creation operators like interval(), for()

### operators categories
RxJS operators can be categorized into different types based on their functionality

| CATEGORY | DESCRIPTION |
|---|---|
| **Transformation Operators** | These operators transform the items emitted by an Observable. Examples include map, pluck, mergeMap (also known as flatMap), switchMap, and concatMap. |
| **Filtering Operators**| These operators filter the items emitted by an Observable based on certain conditions. Examples include filter, take, skip, distinctUntilChanged, and debounceTime. |
| **Combination Operators** | These operators combine multiple Observables into a single Observable. Examples include combineLatest, zip, merge, concat, and forkJoin. |
| **Utility Operators** | These operators provide utility functions to manipulate Observables and handle errors. Examples include tap, delay, finalize, and catchError.|
| **Conditional Operators** | These operators evaluate conditions on items emitted by Observables. Examples include defaultIfEmpty, every, some, and isEmpty. |
| **Aggregate Operators** | These operators perform operations on the entire stream to produce a single value. Examples include reduce, count, max, min, and toArray.|
| **Multicasting Operators** | These operators help manage the sharing of data among multiple subscribers. Examples include share, publish, publishReplay, and shareReplay. |
| **Error Handling Operators** | These operators handle errors that occur within Observables. Examples include catchError, retry, and retryWhen. |
| **Transformational Higher-Order Mapping Operators** | These operators are used to manipulate Observables of Observables, often called "higher-order Observables." Examples include switchMap, mergeMap, concatMap, and exhaustMap. |


### Error Handling with catchError() operator
Error handling operators in RxJS help you manage errors that occur within an Observable stream. They allow you to catch errors, handle them, and potentially recover from them. Here's an example that demonstrates the use of the catchError() operator to handle errors gracefully:

1. Create an Observable that emits values and then throws an error
   ```
     source = new Observable(obs => {
     let stream:any[] = [1,2,3,4,5,'not a number',6,7,8]
     stream.forEach((val) => {
        if(typeof(val) === 'number') {
          obs.next(val)
        }else{
          obs.error("the value is not a number")
        }
      })
      obs.complete()
     })
 
   ```

2. When subscribing directly to this observable, the behaviour will be that when an error occurs, the observable will not emit the remaining values and the complete() function will not be called.
   
   ```
     onSubscribe(){
        this.source.subscribe({
          next: (value) => {
            console.log(value)
          }
          ,error: (err) => console.error(err)
          ,complete: () => console.log("the stream is completed")
        })
       }
   ```

3. We can use the catchError() operator to handle errors. When an error occurs, the provided error handler function logs the error and returns an Observable with a fallback value (of(-1) in this case). then the observer complete() method will be called after catching the error.
   
    ```
      safeSource = this.source.pipe(
        catchError(error => {
          console.error('An error occurred:', error);
          return of(-1); 
        })
       )
      
      this.safeSource.subscribe({
          next: (value) => {
            console.log(value)
          }
          ,error: (err) => console.error(err)
          ,complete: () => console.log("the stream is completed")
        })
    
    ```
